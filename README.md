# dockerized_binance
A repo for the release of the Binance app to be run in docker for extended deployment.
The main purpose is to run this repo within the docker container so it can be deployed anywhere.
Eventually it could even display a webpage but for now it will remain as a method for the system to run.

# Requirements
